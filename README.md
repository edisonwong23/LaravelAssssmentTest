## ðŸ“‚ **Assumptions and Design Choices**
Soft Deletes: Users are soft deleted to allow recovery if needed and to maintain historical data integrity.

Validation: Strict validation rules are applied on user data (email uniqueness, phone number uniqueness, required fields) to ensure data consistency.

Password Handling: Passwords are hashed securely using bcrypt before storage; password updates are optional.

API Resource Routing: Used Laravel resource routes for RESTful API design to standardize endpoints.

Bulk Delete: Provided bulk delete functionality via a POST endpoint for efficient batch operations.

Filtering and Pagination: Filtering by status is supported to allow clients to query active or inactive users; pagination can be added as needed.

Export to Excel: Users can be exported to Excel format for reporting and data analysis.

No Authentication: API endpoints are publicly accessible for simplicity in this implementation; adding authentication is recommended for production.

Error Handling: Validation errors return HTTP 422 with descriptive messages; missing data or invalid requests respond with appropriate status codes.
